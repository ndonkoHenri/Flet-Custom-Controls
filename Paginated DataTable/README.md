# Paginated DataTable
Gets a [DataTable](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/datatable), and breaks it down to pages with a given number of rows per page.
This is meant to ease navigation within a data table.

#### Features:
- jump to first page 
- jump to last page 
- go from page to page (one to the other)
- modify the number of rows per page
- double-click the page number to jump to a particular page number
- show the total number of rows
